Horizon Station is a fork of one of the biggest open source games, <a href="https://github.com/tgstation/tgstation">Space Station 13</a>, using the old BYOND engine.
<br>Space Station 13 is a roleplaying sandbox game about working on a space station and dealing with problems and traitors
<br>The project has enhanced many aspects of the game, and added some incredible features some thought were nigh-impossible due to an outdated engine.
<Br>It features a better character creator, simulated space travel with randomized planets and space ruins to visits; an immersive ambience system and day/night cycles, among many other things!
<br>It has been actively developed, maintained and hosted by myself and a group of friends.
<br>The population peaked at around 30 players, which is decent considering how niche the game is.

<br>The repository is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/sebdaz/HorizonSS13">github</a>.
