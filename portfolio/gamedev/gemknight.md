Gem Knight is an RPG spin on the classic "Match 3" genre of games.
<br>The player needs to match correct tiles in order to attack, defend or open treasure chests.
<br>There are many functional systems implemented in the game, albeit there isn't much assets or content to show them off properly. 
<br>
<br>Built on Unity engine, utilizing my <a href="/portfolio/libs/azsharpecs.html">AzSharp.ECS</a> library.
<br>Created by myself and a couple friends in free time, with me being the sole programmer, unfortunately has been put on hold due to people being busy with their lives.
<br>A build can be downloaded <a href="/assets/portfolio/gemknight/build.7z" download="build.7z">here</a>
